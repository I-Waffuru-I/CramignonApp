# Cramignon App

Tool to help form duos from a list of people. Originally meant to help with the organisation of Cramignons, though who knows if it'll end up getting used. Some quick sketches can be found [here](resources/img), to get an idea of what it'll look like.
> VERY MUCH W.I.P.  
> None of those designs are final.

This is a solo project, albeit with some help of friends to get inspiration for the UI. It also serves as practice for exams :)
